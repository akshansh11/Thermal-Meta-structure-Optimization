# Thermal-Meta-structure-Optimization

This app performs thermal topology optimization - a method of designing materials that efficiently conduct heat from a source to a sink. It starts with a rectangular design space and iteratively removes material while maintaining optimal heat transfer performance. The optimization balances using minimal material (controlled by volume fraction) while creating effective heat conduction paths.
Key parameters users can adjust:

  a) Width & Height: Define the design space resolution (more elements = finer detail but slower)
  b) Volume Fraction (0.1-0.9): Amount of material allowed. Lower values create more sparse designs
  c) Penalization (1.0-5.0): Controls how "binary" the design becomes (higher = more distinct solid/void regions)
  d) Filter Radius (1.0-3.0): Controls feature size and prevents checkerboard patterns

The app shows the design evolution through an animated visualization:

  a) Red/bright regions represent solid material
  b) Blue/dark regions represent void
  c) The design evolves to create efficient heat conduction paths
  d) Progress bar shows optimization status
  e) Final animation can be downloaded as GIF

Practical applications include:

  a) Heat sink design
  b) Thermal management in electronics
  c) Energy-efficient material design
  d) Thermal metamaterial development

The optimization typically takes 50-100 iterations to converge, with the final design representing an efficient thermal conductor using the specified amount of material.
